TODO
----
- Implement basic collision, splitting, varied sizes of asteriods
  - For now, implement ellipse collision

- Use apache commons math lib (Matrix implementation)?

- implement TransformedTimeline

- add zoom

- add light pulses

- replace List<Timeline> with List<Object/Entity/Asteroid/?> in SRAsteroids

- remove objects when timeline is in past; requires adding object abstraction

- traditional asteroids requires bounded environment; lorentz contractions break naive
  implementation of wrapping at boundaries. Different game mechanic in infinite space? Different
  wrapping implementation? Temporal limits (e.g. asteroids are fast but short-lived?)

- IMPORTANT: seenBy exhibits weird behavior, not sure if buggy or just not intuitive. Need to
  determine whether it can be built on top of, or whether I should use concurrentWith, which is
  less physically accurate, but more stable.

- implement a lazy physics engine, RK4?
- implement WorldView : the position of all objects in a simulation, as seen by a particular
  observer moving at a particular speed. To simulate, an object should request a WorldView from
  the World, giving its own position and relative velocity, and use that to simulate a timestep.
  Problem: use seenBy or concurrentWith?
- implement SimulatedTimeline
    ctor: SimulatedTimeline(Event initialEvent)
    state: ArbitraryTimeline path
    update(Event observer, Velocity velocity, float tMin):
      simulate the path of this timeline until this.end() > tMin as observer by the observer
      moving at velocity. Problem: use seenBy or concurrentWith? seenBy exhibits weird behavior,
      not sure if buggy or just not intuitive.

- write Force abstraction, then in mainLoop
    for (Entity e : entities) {
      for (Force f : e.getForces()) {
        e.accelerate(f, dt)
      }
    }
- add SpringForce
- research GR: what would it take to add gravity?
- research EM: what would it take to add electromagnetic forces? I know electrical forces and magnetic forces can be transformed into each other through lorentz transformations, if implement naive "k q1 q2 / d12^2" without magnetism it will be inconsistent when transformed.
